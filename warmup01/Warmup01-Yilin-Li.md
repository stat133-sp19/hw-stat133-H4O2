Sausage-stuffed potatoes + A green salad
----------------------------------------

#### Ingradients

-   2 large russet (baking) potatoes (preferably organic; 3/4 pound each, scrubbed
-   3 tablespoons mayonnaise
-   1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon water, divided
-   3/4 teaspoon tomato paste
-   1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste
-   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, divided
-   1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
-   1 tablespoon olive oil plus additional for coating potatoes
-   1/2 slice firm white sandwich bread
-   1 tablespoon milk
-   1/2 pound bulk breakfast sausage (1 cup) or 1/2 pound of breakfast sausage, casings removed
-   1 tablespoon chopped parsley
-   1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
-   5 cups salad greens (2 ounces)(we used arugula, which paired with the dijon sauce was deliciously kicky)

#### "Special" kitchen tools

-   Tablespoon
-   Teaspoon
-   Oven
-   Paper towel

#### Step

1.  Prick potatoes with a fork. Microwave, covered with a paper towel, on high power until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

2.  Cutting lengthwise, remove top fourth of each potato and scoop out centers (reserve for another use), leaving 1/2-inch-thick walls.

3.  Whisk together mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon water, tomato paste, anchovy paste, and 1 1/2 tablespoons mustard.

4.  Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.

5.  Cook onion in oil with a pinch of salt in a small heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes.

6.  Meanwhile, tear bread into small pieces, then soak in milk in a medium bowl until very soft. Mix in sausage, parsley, onion, and 2 tablespoons mayonnaise sauce with your hands.

7.  Divide filling between potatoes, then coat skins lightly with oil. Bake in a 4-sided sheet pan until sausage is cooked through, about 30 minutes.

8.  While potatoes bake, whisk 1 tablespoon mayonnaise sauce with lemon juice, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon mustard and 1/2 teaspoon water, and salt and pepper to taste.

9.  Remove potatoes from oven and turn on broiler. Spoon remaining mayonnaise sauce over filling and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until charred in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool slightly.

10. Toss greens with dressing and serve with potatoes.

#### Appearance of the meal

It seems *no* special seasons and other variations.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

#### Definition <font size="2"> \[edit\] </font>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($ $).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) , if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q** , or from **q** to **q** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

$$
\\begin{equation}
{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}d(\\mathbf {p} ,\\mathbf {q} )=d(\\mathbf {q} ,\\mathbf {p} )&={\\sqrt {(q\_{1}-p\_{1})^{2}+(q\_{2}-p\_{2})^{2}+\\cdots +(q\_{n}-p\_{n})^{2}}}\\\\\[8pt\]&={\\sqrt {\\sum \_{i=1}^{n}(q\_{i}-p\_{i})^{2}}}.\\end{aligned}}}
\\end{equation}
$$

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$
{\\displaystyle \\left\\|\\mathbf {p} \\right\\|={\\sqrt {p\_{1}^{2}+p\_{2}^{2}+\\cdots +p\_{n}^{2}}}={\\sqrt {\\mathbf {p} \\cdot \\mathbf {p} }},}
$$
 where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
