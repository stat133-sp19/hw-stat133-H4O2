#### Description of the homework

The **purpose** of this assignment is threefold: 

* From the logistical point of view, this assignment is the opportunity to start working with a more complex file structure, and uploading files to GitHub. 

* From the analytics point of view, this HW involves visualizing shot data of NBA players. More especifically, produce so-called “shot charts” for a handful of players from the Golden State Warriors, as well as other summaries and visualizations. 

* From the report/communication standpoint, produce a report document that is not just a boring list of code-and-output without a narrative.


The **content** of this assignment:

* The content is mainly about manipulating, visulizing and analysising the scoring, especially shooting data on the five star players from the Golden State Warriors.

* Then use these to write a entire report on the performance of them and reach some conclusion.
