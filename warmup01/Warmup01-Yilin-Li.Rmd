## Star Wars

**Freya Fenris** was a human female pilot who served with Ace Squadron, a team of starship racers that also flew defense for the Colossus platform. Fenris' personal starfighter was the Red Ace.



**A famous quote by Freya Fenris:**

> We'll have to bring her in manually. Follow my signal.

##Sausage-stuffed potatoes + A green salad

####Ingradients
*  2 large russet (baking) potatoes (preferably organic; 3/4 pound each, scrubbed
*  3 tablespoons mayonnaise
*  1 tablespoon plus 1/2 teaspoon water, divided
*  3/4 teaspoon tomato paste
*  1/2 teaspoon anchovy paste
*  2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, divided
*  1/2 medium onion, finely chopped
*  1 tablespoon olive oil plus additional for coating potatoes
*  1/2 slice firm white sandwich bread
*  1 tablespoon milk
*  1/2 pound bulk breakfast sausage (1 cup) or 1/2 pound of breakfast sausage, casings removed
*  1 tablespoon chopped parsley
*  1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice
*  5 cups salad greens (2 ounces)(we used arugula, which paired with the dijon sauce was deliciously kicky)

####"Special" kitchen tools

*  Tablespoon
*  Teaspoon
*  Oven
*  Paper towel

####Step

1. Prick potatoes with a fork. Microwave, covered with a paper towel, on high power until tender, 10 to 12 minutes.

2. Cutting lengthwise, remove top fourth of each potato and scoop out centers (reserve for another use), leaving 1/2-inch-thick walls.

3. Whisk together mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon water, tomato paste, anchovy paste, and 1 1/2 tablespoons mustard.

4. Preheat oven to 350°F with rack in middle.

5. Cook onion in oil with a pinch of salt in a small heavy skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until golden, about 10 minutes.

6. Meanwhile, tear bread into small pieces, then soak in milk in a medium bowl until very soft. Mix in sausage, parsley, onion, and 2 tablespoons mayonnaise sauce with your hands.

7. Divide filling between potatoes, then coat skins lightly with oil. Bake in a 4-sided sheet pan until sausage is cooked through, about 30 minutes.

8. While potatoes bake, whisk 1 tablespoon mayonnaise sauce with lemon juice, remaining 1 1/2 teaspoon mustard and 1/2 teaspoon water, and salt and pepper to taste.

9. Remove potatoes from oven and turn on broiler. Spoon remaining mayonnaise sauce over filling and broil 3 to 4 inches from heat until charred in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Cool slightly.

10. Toss greens with dressing and serve with potatoes.

## Euclidean Distance



#### Definition  <font size="2"> [edit] </font>
______
The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\overline {\mathbf {p} \mathbf {q} } $).

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_product) , if $\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2,..., p_n)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (q_1, q_2,..., q_n)$ are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from $\mathbf{p}$ to $\mathbf{q}$ , or from $\mathbf{q}$ to $\mathbf{q}$  is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem):

$$
\begin{equation}
{\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}d(\mathbf {p} ,\mathbf {q} )=d(\mathbf {q} ,\mathbf {p} )&={\sqrt {(q_{1}-p_{1})^{2}+(q_{2}-p_{2})^{2}+\cdots +(q_{n}-p_{n})^{2}}}\\[8pt]&={\sqrt {\sum _{i=1}^{n}(q_{i}-p_{i})^{2}}}.\end{aligned}}}
\end{equation}
$$


The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$ may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:
$$
{\displaystyle \left\|\mathbf {p} \right\|={\sqrt {p_{1}^{2}+p_{2}^{2}+\cdots +p_{n}^{2}}}={\sqrt {\mathbf {p} \cdot \mathbf {p} }},}
$$
where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
